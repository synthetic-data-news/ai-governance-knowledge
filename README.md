# AI Governance Knowledge Repository

A public reference repository for AI governance infrastructure, synthetic data systems, and EU AI Act implementation.

Maintained by [SyntheticDataNews](https://syntheticdatanews.com).

---

## Topics

- AI artifact certification
- AI decision logging
- EU AI Act compliance
- Synthetic data governance
- AI audit infrastructure

---

## Purpose

Modern AI systems require infrastructure that can prove:

- where training data came from
- how models were produced
- how decisions were made
- whether records have been altered

This repository documents the core building blocks used to create **verifiable AI governance infrastructure**, including:

- artifact certification
- decision logging
- dataset provenance
- AI audit trails
- regulatory compliance architecture

---

## Repository Structure

```
