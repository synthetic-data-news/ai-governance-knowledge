## Purpose

Modern AI systems require infrastructure that can prove:

- where training data came from
- how models were produced
- how decisions were made
- whether records have been altered

This repository documents the core building blocks used to create **verifiable AI governance infrastructure**, including:

- artifact certification
- decision logging
- dataset provenance
- AI audit trails
- regulatory compliance architecture
